Making a security system using an Arduino board. This will be a very basic system but may become more complicated in the future. I'm recording my steps here for anyone who wants to follow along to make a system like this. 

It will have horns, a magnetic sensor, and a control panel for the user to arm/disarm and set a password for the system. I plan on adding battery backup in the future to help protect against damage or power failure. I will also list the items used here and my electrical diagrams and schematics, along with any models and 3d print files I may generate or create. This will be modeled by myself to the best of my abilities. 


Items Used:

(2) 12V, 15W Horns (Bought)

(1) Magnetic Door Sensor (Bought)

(1) 3D Printed Control Box (Printed)

Mockup Update 1/6/2024:

The latest model files and mock-up files are the finalized mock-up models. I will now work on an Alpha design that will look more visually pleasing while remaining durable. 
The code for the controller is still being developed and worked on as well.
